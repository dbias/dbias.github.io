title: "Decomposing Within-Firm Wage Inequality"
collection: research
permalink: 
excerpt: 'Using employee-level data from Germany, we show that wage differences among employees who perform similar tasks (horizontal wage inequality, HWI) and among employees who perform different tasks (vertical wage inequality, VWI) contribute equally to the overall wage inequality within firms. A wage model with employee and establishment fixed effects reveals that VWI is nearly exclusively explained by the remuneration for heterogeneous employee characteristics (e.g., ability or education). For HWI, employee characteristics explain about three-quarters, and suggestive evidence based on differences in human resource policies, firm profitability, and monitoring costs reveals that pay-for-performance schemes are a plausible explanation for the remaining quarter.'
