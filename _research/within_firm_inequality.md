title: "Decomposing Within-Firm Wage Inequality"
collection: research
permalink: 
excerpt: 'Using matched employer-employee data from Germany, we show that wage differences among employees who perform similar tasks (horizontal wage inequality, HWI) and employees who perform different tasks (vertical wage inequality, VWI) contribute equally to the overall wage inequality within firms. While VWI can be almost exclusively explained by the remuneration for employee characteristics (e.g., ability or education), these employee heterogeneities explain only about three-quarters in HWI. The remaining unexplained quarter is positively correlated with the existence of profit sharing programs, written employee assessments, written employee targets, firm profitability, and monitoring costs measured by the task complexity of an occupation and the size of an establishment or firm. These findings suggests that pay-for-performance schemes are a plausible explanation for the quarter of HWI that is not related to employee characteristics.'
