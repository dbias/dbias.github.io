title: "Within-Firm Wage Inequality and Employee Incentives"
collection: 
permalink: 
excerpt: 'Recent transparency policies call for the disclosure of wage differences among peer employees within firms to combat wage inequality. Using a large, matched employer-employee dataset for Germany, we analyze how this horizontal wage dispersion among employees with similar individual characteristics and tasks is related to incentive pay. To this end, we decompose the overall within-firm wage inequality into wage differences that can be explained by employee characteristics, task heterogeneity, and residual wage inequality (RWI). RWI captures monetary rewards for employees outperforming their peers and accounts for 12 percent of the overall wage differences within firms. RWI increases in proxies for incentive pay, such as task complexity, firm size, establishment size within firms, profit-sharing programs, and firm profitability. These findings suggest that when debating about horizontal pay inequality, it is crucial to take incentive pay into consideration as it plays a significant role for firms. '
