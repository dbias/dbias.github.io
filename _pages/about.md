I am a Financial Economist, Data Scientist, and Python Enthusiast.

I am a Wallenberg Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Finance at Stockholm School of Economics](https://www.hhs.se/en/research/departments/df/ "Department of Finance at Stockholm School of Economics") and at the [Swedish House of Finance](https://www.hhs.se/en/houseoffinance/ "Swedish House of Finance"), where I am part of the Wallenberg research lab of Prof. Alexander Ljungqvist. The purpose of the Wallenberg research lab is to conduct economic research under the highest scientific standards with a focus on the economic impacts of the decreasing number of public firms.

My research interests are Corporate Finance, Finance and Labor, Entrepreneurial Finance, Innovation, and Networks.

I hold a Ph.D. in Finance from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.wi.tum.de/ "Technical University of Munich") (TUM) and have visited the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.fbe.hku.hk/ "University of Hong Kong") (HKU) and [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.bm.ust.hk/fina/ "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology") (HKUST) during my Ph.D.

I am on the job market and will be available for interviews at the European Job Market for Economists 2021 and ASSA 2022 meetings.
