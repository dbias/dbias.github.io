I am a Financial Economist, Data Scientist, and Python Enthusiast.

I am an Assistant Professor of Finance in the [Owen Graduate School of Management](https://business.vanderbilt.edu/our-school/faculty/finance/ "Owen Graduate School of Management") at Vanderbilt University. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Finance at Stockholm School of Economics](https://www.hhs.se/en/research/departments/df/ "Department of Finance at Stockholm School of Economics") and at the [Swedish House of Finance](https://www.hhs.se/en/houseoffinance/ "Swedish House of Finance"), where I was part of the Wallenberg lab. The Wallenberg lab conducts research in financial economics with a focus on the economic implications of the decreasing number of public firms.

My research interests are Entrepreneurial Finance and Labor & Finance.

#I hold a Ph.D. in Finance from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.wi.tum.de/ "Technical University of Munich") (TUM) and have visited the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.fbe.hku.hk/ "University of Hong Kong") (HKU) and [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.bm.ust.hk/fina/ "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology") (HKUST) during my Ph.D.
