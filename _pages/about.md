I am a Financial Economist, Data Scientist, and Python Enthusiast.

I am a Wallenberg Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Finance at Stockholm School of Economics](https://www.hhs.se/en/research/departments/df/ "Department of Finance at Stockholm School of Economics") and at the [Swedish House of Finance](https://www.hhs.se/en/houseoffinance/ "Swedish House of Finance"), where I am part of the Wallenberg research lab of Prof. Alexander Ljungqvist. The Wallenberg research lab conducts research in finacial economics with a focus on the economic implications of the decreasing number of public firms. It is a research lab inspired by the natural sciences, with standardized procedures and the highest standards of transparency and research ethics.

My research interests are Corporate Finance, Finance and Labor, Entrepreneurial Finance, Innovation, and Networks.

I hold a Ph.D. in Finance from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.wi.tum.de/ "Technical University of Munich") (TUM) and have visited the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.fbe.hku.hk/ "University of Hong Kong") (HKU) and [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.bm.ust.hk/fina/ "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology") (HKUST) during my Ph.D.
